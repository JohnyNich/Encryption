# Encryption
A demo program developed in Python which gives an example of how encryption works.
The encryption used in this program is purley made up and not used in any software but it is still a good example of how encryption works.
If you want to decrypt text that you just encrypted without having to enter in the sequence (that's what I like to call the encrypted message), type in debugging mode when prompted if what you want to do.
Disclaimer: This program does NOT work with encrypting or decrypting any messages with anything that's not a letter (no numbers or symobls).
