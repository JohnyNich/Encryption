# Encryption
A demo program developed in Python which gives an example of how encryption works.
The encryption used in this program is purley made up and not used in any software but it is still a good example of how encryption works.
If you want to decrypt text that you just encrypted without having to enter in the sequence (that's what I like to call the encrypted message), type in debugging mode when prompted if what you want to do.

The following options are changeable in the config file:
  Animation: Changing the moving text animation
  Additional Write Text: Word: Sequence vs Sequence (eg. hi: 1819WU2 vs 1819WU2)
  Auto Write: When program start's up, write mode is automatically enabled.
  Auto Debug: When program start's up, debugging mode is automatically enabled.
Note: Please remember when changing config optionts that the input can either be True or False.
